# Question 3

In this problem you will update a document in the Enron dataset to illustrate your mastery of updating documents from the shell.

Please add the email address "mrpotatohead@mongodb.com" to the list of addresses in the "headers.To" array for the document with "headers.Message-ID" of "<8147308.1075851042335.JavaMail.evans@thyme>"

After you have completed that task, please download final3.zip from the Download Handout link and run final3-validate.js to get the validation code and put it in the box below without any extra spaces. The validation script assumes that it is connecting to a simple mongo instance on the standard port on localhost.
