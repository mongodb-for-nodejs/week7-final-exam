# Question 8

Suppose you have a three node replica set. Node 1 is the primary. Node 2 is a secondary, Node 3 is a secondary running with a delay of two hours. All writes to the database are issued with w=majority and j=1 (by which we mean that the getLastError call has those values set).

A write operation (could be insert or update) is initiated from your application using the Node.js driver at time=0. At time=5 seconds, the primary, Node 1, goes down for an hour and node 2 is elected primary. Note that your write operation has not yet returned at the time of the failure. Note also that although you have not received a response from the write, it has been processed and written by Node 1 before the failure. Node 3, since it has a slave delay option set, is lagging.


Will there be a rollback of data on Node 1 when Node 1 comes back up? Choose the best answer.

* Yes, always
* No, never
* Maybe, it depends on whether Node 3 has processed the write
* Maybe, it depends on whether Node 2 has processed the write
